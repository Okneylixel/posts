# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. I'm used [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for database posts, message and auth. Deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=next-website)

# Practice creating a messaging board. You can publicize your message and anyone can see what you post. The dashboard has an authorization system, you can comment on what you want, delete, and edit your post. Feel free to post something :)
